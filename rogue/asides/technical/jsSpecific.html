<h2>Language Specifics</h2>

<p>There are some concepts that are core to almost every programming language that are commonly encountered, like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.  There are also language specific features, or features that are only found in a small subset of languages (asynchronous functions are a good example in the case of Javascript). When covering a new concept, this guide will note whether it is a general feature or a feature specific to Javascript/similar languages.  Most specific features will not be covered until later on.</p>
